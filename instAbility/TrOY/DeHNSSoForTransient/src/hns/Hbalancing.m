%% Description
% Hbalancing creates a 3D matrix that will be used to calculate
% the source terms for the ILPSE solver. In each matrix HB(:,:,j), a 1 
% means that the modes corresponding to the row and column index of that 
% entry interact to force that mode j. For example, for N = 2, M = 0, 
% HB(:,:,3) corresponding to the MFD will look like:

%    n,m -2,0   -1,0    0,0     1,0     2,0        
%  n,m    __________________________________
% -2,0   | 0      0      0       0       1
% -1,0   | 0      0      0       1       0
%  0,0   | 0      0      1       0       0
% -1,0   | 0      1      0       0       0
% -2,0   | 1      0      0       0       0

% As the interactions (-2,0)x(2,0), (-1,0)x(1,0), (0,0)x(0,0), (1,0)x(-1,0
% and (2,0)x(-2,0) all force the MFD (0,0). In practice, the interaction
% (0,0)x(0x0) is excluded from forcing term calculations however.

% M       (1,1)                     [-]  Number of modes in t
% N       (1,1)                     [-]  Number of modes in z

% Modevec ((M+1)*(N+1),1)           [-]  Contains the m and n of the modecounter l

%%  Outputs
%   HB (Harmonic Balancing) is a collection of [2M+1]x[2N+1] matrices of size [2M+1]x[2N+1]
%   stored as a 3D matrix where every matrix is a binary matrix that serves
%   as a registry for the source amplitudes that affect that respective mode.

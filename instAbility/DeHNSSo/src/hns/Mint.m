%% Description
% mint (Mode INTeractions) is a function that sets up a matrix containing the
% modes affected by the interactions of all currently represented modes

% Outputs Mmat and Nmat are mode numbers for beta and omega respectively.
% Output Modevec is the mode vector [m(1:2M+1);n(1:2M+1)] for every mode
% counter l_{m,n}.

%% Inputs
% Name  size    unit explanation
% M     (1,1)   [-]  Modal truncation in t
% N     (1,1)   [-]  Modal truncation in z

%% Outputs
% Name    size                      unit explanation
% Mmat    (M+1)*(N+1) x (M+1)*(N+1) [-]  Contains the m part of the modes affected by the mode interactions
% Nmat    (M+1)*(N+1) x (M+1)*(N+1) [-]  Contains the n part of the modes affected by the mode interactions
% Modevec (M+1)*(N+1) x 2           [-]  Contains the m and n of the modecounter l
% Mvec    (M+1)*(N+1) x 1           [-]  Contains the m of the modecounter l
% Nvec    (M+1)*(N+1) x 1           [-]  Contains the n of the modecounter l
